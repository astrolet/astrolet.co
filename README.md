This website was opensourced mostly to serve as example of [beverage](https://github.com/gulpsome/beverage) + [gulp-harp](https://github.com/gulpsome/gulp-harp) workflow.

## Prerequisites

Have Node.js / npm and Ruby 2+ installed.  Ruby is for [Compass](http://compass-style.org) styles.

## Develop

```shell
npm install
npm i -g beverage
beverage dev
```

Links for live-reloading with [browser-sync](https://www.browsersync.io) will log in the console.

Beverage isn't special, run `gulp dev` if you so prefer.
Run `gulp` or `beverage` commands to list all the tasks.
